**NULA Gallery Volume 1**

This production demonstrates the capabilities of the enhanced ULA board created for the BBC Micro by RobC by presenting a slide show of 16-colour MODE 2 images that have been colour quantized to use the most optimal 16-colour palette from the NuLA 12-bit range of 4096 colours.

This Gallery Volume is themed around Computer Games & Graphics.

See the thread on [Stardot forums](http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=12150&sid=87a683dc7df121a211b4ddda498500e6) for more information about VideoNuLA.

*NOTE: This demo will not work in JSBeeb since it does not have the NuLA emulation support. Instead use the modified versions of B-Em.*
