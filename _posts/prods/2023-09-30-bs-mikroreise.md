**Mikroreise**

The [Deadline](https://deadline.untergrund.net/) demoparty in Berlin has a unique [Three Dee competition](https://deadline.untergrund.net/2023/compos/) in which participants are challenged to make the best demo production using [Anaglyph 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D). This is a stereoscopic 3D effect using red-cyan filtered glasses.

Mikroreise means Micro Journey (or Small Trip) in German, and was our humble entry for the compo. You will need some red-cyan glasses to see this demo in 3D!!

Run on real Archimedes hardware with RISC OS 3.1, or if running under emulation, use [Arculator v2.1+](http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/). For best emulated experience, emulate an A3020 and select sound output filter -> more reduced. This demo requires 4Mb RAM, yeah sorry about that (but the music is great). Party version is ARM250 only but an ARM2 will be supported in the final version, honest.

For best audio quality on real Archimedes hardware we recommend removing the hardware low-pass filter by following the instructions on this [thread](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13630).
