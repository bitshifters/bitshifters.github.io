**BEEB-NICCC**

A loving recreation of the classic demo STNICCC-2000 by Oxygene. Released at the Revision 2020 demoparty in the Oldskool Demo compo.

***Known Issues***
16K Sideways RAM is required in slot 4. This will be made configurable in an update coming soon.

This party version only works on real floppy disc hardware or Gotek. DataCentre and MMC devices may suffer slowdown issues. Known bug sometimes causes freeze on Model B. Version 1.1 will be released asap!
