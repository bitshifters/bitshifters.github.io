**Master / Mode7**

A 256b (well, 254b!) intro for the BBC Master.

By VectorEyes of Bitshifters.

This started out as an experiment to see how faithfully I could reproduce the *astounding* C64 256b demo “A Mind is Born”. The answer turned out to be: not very well at all, so I took things in a different direction and hacked together something that uses the BBC Master’s Teletext capabilities (Mode 7) to display a few different patterns. I hope you enjoy it!

The music is semi-random. I was incredibly lucky to capture a video where the last few bars sound like a proper ‘ending’. At some point soon I'll make a version that seeds the RNG properly and produces fully consistent music.
