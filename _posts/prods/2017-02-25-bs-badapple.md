**"Bad Apple" - The definitive BBC Micro/Teletext Version**

The Tou Hou Bad Apple [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3C-VevI36s) has become a benchmark for pushing retro computing power to the limits. While it has been ported to many other 8-bit platforms, we are now pleased to present the definitive BBC Micro version in glorious Teletext pixel graphics. 

Our version is a full 3m18s of video playback, played back at 25 frames per second in Teletext / MODE 7.

The music is a custom VGM chiptune, hand designed by [Inverse Phase](http://www.inversephase.com/) for the BBC Micro's SN76489.

Every part of the demo you see is crammed into a standard BBC Micro's 32Kb RAM and is heavily compressed to fit on one single 400Kb double sided floppy disk image.
