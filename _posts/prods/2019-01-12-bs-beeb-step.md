**BEEB STEP**

This demo was inspired by a [Battle of the Bits chip tune "SMStep" created by TMM12](http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/SMStep/24092/) that runs the sound chip at 392Hz instead of the usual 50Hz to enable dub step beats and sounds of the likes we've never heard before on a BBC Micro! The original VGM tune was transposed from 3.58Mhz NTSC to a 4MHz clock frequency and a dedicated playback routine was created so that we can enjoy it on our beebs.

This demo requires a BBC Micro with at least four banks of 16K sideways RAM because the tune data is HUGE!

Enjoy!
