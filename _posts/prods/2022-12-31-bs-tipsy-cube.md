**Tipsy Cube**

A small intro featuring a very tipsy cube for the [FieldFX](https://field-fx.party/) 2022 New Year's Demostream. Heavily inspired by the [Gerp 2014 rubber cube challenge](http://ada.untergrund.net/?p=boardthread&id=919&page=0). Better late than never!

Run on real Archimedes hardware with RISC OS 3.1 or 2, or if running under emulation, use [Arculator v2.1+](http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/). For best emulated experience, emulate an A3010 and select sound output filter -> more reduced. This demo requires 2Mb RAM minimum.

For best audio quality on real Archimedes hardware we recommend removing the hardware low-pass filter by following the instructions on this [thread](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13630).

Download the Archimedes disk image (ADFS 800K E Format) below or get the [!Spark](https://www.4corn.co.uk/articles/sparkplug/) archive [here](../../content/bs-tipsy-cube,ddc).

The `Emulate` button below is hardcoded for BBC prods, oops. But don't worry, you can emulate using [Archimedes Live](https://archi.medes.live/#disc=https://bitshifters.github.io/content/bs-tipsy-cube.zip&autoboot=desktop%20filer_run%20adfs::0.$.!Tipsy&preset=a3020) instead!
