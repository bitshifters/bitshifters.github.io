**Chequered Past**

At the end of 2017, Blueberry issued a [Checkerboard Challenge](https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=11224&page=1) to take place at [Gerp 2018](https://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=1655&when=2018). There were many fine entries for Amiga and Atari, ranging from 6 to 13 checkerboard layers. So we might be five years late to the party, but we thought it might be fun to see what can be achieved on the Acorn Archimedes, a machine without bitplane video modes or any blitter-like support chips. Our best result was 8 layers on ARM250 (12Mhz) and 6 layers on ARM2 (8Mhz). Let us know if you can do any better - we'd love to see it!

Run on real Archimedes hardware with RISC OS 3.1 or 2, or if running under emulation, use [Arculator v2.1+](http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/). For best emulated experience, emulate an A3020 and select sound output filter -> more reduced. This demo requires 4Mb RAM, yeah sorry.

For best audio quality on real Archimedes hardware we recommend removing the hardware low-pass filter by following the instructions on this [thread](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13630).
