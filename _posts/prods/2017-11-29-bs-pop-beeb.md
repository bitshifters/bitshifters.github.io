**Prince of Persia**

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

After the original Apple II 6502 source code was recovered and uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II) by the author Jordan Mechner, I decided to take it upon myself to port this to the BBC Master computer, given that it shares the same 6502 CPU and 128K RAM. That was the theory at least. :) There are a lot of interesting technical challenges involved in this project but I believe it is possible to create a faithful version of the game that features the best aspects of the BBC Micro. The current work in progress will be shared here until there is an official release.

See the thread on [Stardot forums](http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=13079) for more information and a development blog of sorts.

BBC Computer keyboard layout (your emulator layout may vary!):
* [Z] - left
* [ X] - right
* [\*] - up
* [?] - down
* [\+] - jump left
* [}] - jump right
* [RETURN] - action (step, grab, pickup, attack etc.)
