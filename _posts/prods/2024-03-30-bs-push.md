**Push**



Run on real Archimedes hardware with RISC OS 3.1, or if running under emulation, use [Arculator v2.1+](http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/). For best emulated experience, emulate an A3020 and select sound output filter -> more reduced.

For best audio quality on real Archimedes hardware we recommend removing the hardware low-pass filter by following the instructions on this [thread](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13630).
