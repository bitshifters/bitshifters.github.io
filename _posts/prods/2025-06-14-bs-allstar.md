**Allstar Megademo**

An epic four part megademo for the Acorn Archimedes released at NOVA 2025 in the Oldschool Demo Compo, winning first place! This demo is designed for original 8MHz ARM2 machines with minimum 2Mb RAM. It will run from real floppy disks, although it's so epic that it spans three of them!

Run on real Archimedes hardware with RISC OS 3.1, or if running under emulation, use [Arculator v2.1+](http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/). For best emulated experience, emulate an A3020 and select sound output filter -> more reduced.

For best audio quality on real Archimedes hardware we recommend removing the hardware low-pass filter by following the instructions on this [thread](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=13630).

Powered by [QTM](http://www.pi-star.co.uk/qtm/) MOD player and [RasterMan](http://www.pi-star.co.uk/rasterman/) software copper, huge thanks to Phoenix^Quantum for maintaining these and continuing to provide updates when we need them!
