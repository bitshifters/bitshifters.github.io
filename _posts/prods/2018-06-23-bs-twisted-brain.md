**TWISTED BRAIN** aka **#noteletext #justrasters**

This demo will twist the 6845 CRTC video chip in your BBC Master computer in new and previously untested ways. Consequently we kinda broke your favourite emulator a little bit, sorry about that! ;)

Twisted Brain was released at the [Nova 18 demoparty](http://www.novaparty.org/) in Budleigh Salterton, Devon on 23 June 2018 and entered into the Old School compo.

This demo requires a BBC Master system as it uses all 64K of sideways RAM, 12K of Hazel RAM and the 20K shadow RAM for all manner of jiggery-pokery. Many cycles were counted and many NOP's sacrificed during the making of this demo.

If your CRTC chip doesn't like being twisted (if you experience any glitches or have compatibility problems) please [let us know](https://bitshifters.github.io/info.html)!

**NEW:** Long and detailed technical "Making of" thread can be found on the [Stardot forum](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=15300)!
