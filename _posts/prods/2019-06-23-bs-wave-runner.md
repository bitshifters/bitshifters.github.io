**WAVE RUNNER**

Released at the Nova 2019 demoparty, this demo features 'Stable Raster' and 'Vertical Rupture' techniques, along with some cool images from Dethmunk and a converted YM2149F tune originally written by Scavenger.

Jointly developed by VectorEyes and Tom Seddon, prototyping started several months before the party and the demo was finished in a mad rush on the day of the competition. Thanks to Henley for the music player and tune conversion, and Hexwab for the player optimisations.

Wave Runner uses several Master-specific features that aren't supported by older emulators. It runs on B2, runs with graphical glitches on B-Em, and won't work on BeebEm or JSBeeb.
