**WAVE RUNNER**

Released at the Nova 2019 demoparty, this demo features 'Stable Raster' and 'Vertical Rupture' techniques, along with some cool images from Dethmunk and a converted YM2149F tune originally written by Scavenger.

Jointly developed by VectorEyes and Tom Seddon, prototyping started several months before the party and the demo was finished in a mad rush on the day of the competition. Thanks to Henley for the music player and tune conversion, and Hexwab for the player optimisations.

Wave Runner uses several Master-specific features that aren't supported by older emulators. It runs on B2, runs with graphical glitches on B-Em, and won't work on BeebEm or JSBeeb.

**EDIT: Thanks to Tom Seddon & Matt Godbolt, JSBeeb now runs the demo!**

The latest and best version is v1.1, released in August 2019. It fixes one obvious bug (bad scrolltext colours) and improves the timing of some effect transitions. If you're looking for the original 'party' version, it's [here](https://bitshifters.github.io/content/bs-wave-runner.ssd).
