Write a **game, demo, graphic effect, or anything fun / interesting** that runs in & showcases MODE 7.

Preferred target machine is standard BBC Micro with DFS for broadest possible distribution but submissions that rely on original hardware extensions (e.g. B+, Master, SWRAM, ADFS, 2nd processor) are also accepted.
All submissions must run on original hardware.

Things to think about: ideas that could only be achieved in MODE 7, using & abusing the character mapped display of MODE 7.
